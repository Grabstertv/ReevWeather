# Reev Weather

Reev Weather are a set of minimalist outline based icons for you to use in your products for free! All I ask in return is a single line credit anywhere in your product.

# Availability

All icons are available in SVGs, PNGs, Fonticons as well as Kustom fonticons to be used in KLWP, KWGT and KLCK. You can find the weather Kustom formula in the Kustom folder.

# Usage

Reev Weather icons are licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. Meaning you can do whatever the fuck you want with them. All i ask in return is you give credit and link to this repo anywhere in your product so more people can find and use these icons in their projects.
