## Reev Weather

Reev Weather are a set of minimalist outline based icons for you to use in your products for free! All I ask in return is a single line credit anywhere in your app/wherever you use the icons.

## Availability

All icons are available in SVGs, PNGs, Fonticons as well as Kustom fonticons to be used in KLWP, KWGT and KLCK. You can find the weather Kustom formula in the Kustom folder. Compatibility with native weather formula is coming soon.

## Usage

Reev Weather icons are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license. Meaning you can share and adapt as long as you give proper credits anywhere in your product.

## Extended number of icons

Reev Pro is an icon pack for Android containing over 1,200 icons in the same, minimalist outline design. [Click here to get Reev Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reevpro.grabsterstudios).
